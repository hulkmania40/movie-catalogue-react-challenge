# Movie Catalogue React Challenge

## React + TypeScript + Vite

Fork the repo and use:

```npm run dev```

Make sure that on clicking the options, the user is able to view the clicked movie item with it's details on the left.
Also make sure that the selected movie item is highlighted, just the way the first item in the preview is.

## Happy Solving!!
